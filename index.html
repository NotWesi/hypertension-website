                <h1>Silence Can Be Deadly</h1>
                <p>Hypertension, also known as the 'Silent Killer', is a common chronic condition that often goes unnoticed due to it's lack of symptoms. <br> 
                It can lead to serious problems such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure.</p>

            <h1>About Hypertension</h1>
            <p>There are three important things to understand when learning about hypertension: blood pressure, prevalence, and risk factors.
            All information is taken from the World Health Organization (WHO) website.</p>

                    <h3>Blood Pressure</h3>
                    <p>Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure.
                    Blood is carried from the heart to all parts of the body in the vessels. Each time the heart beats, it pumps blood into the vessels.
                    Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. 
                    The higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump. </p>
                </div> 
            
                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3>Prevalence</h3>
                    <p>Hypertension is a serious medical condition and can increase the risk of heart, brain, kidney and other diseases.
                    It is a major cause of premature death worldwide, with upwards of 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women – over a billion people – having the condition.
                    The burden of hypertension is felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries, where two thirds of cases are found, largely due to increased risk factors in those populations in recent decades.</p>

                    <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                    <p>Hypertension can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary hypertension.
                    The main difference between the two is that secondary hypertension is caused by an underlying condition. Some of the common risk factors include
                    age, race, being overweight or obese, not being physically active, using tobacco, too much sodium in diet, alcohol, stress and certain underlying conditions.</p>

                     <h3>Heart Attack or Stroke</h3>
                     <p>High blood pressure can cause hardening and thickening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack, stroke or other complications.</p>
                 </div>

                     <h3>Heart Failure</h3>
                     <p>To pump blood against the higher pressure in your vessels, the heart has to work harder. 
                     This causes the walls of the heart's pumping chamber to thicken (left ventricular hypertrophy). 
                     Eventually, the thickened muscle may have a hard time pumping enough blood to meet your body's needs, which can lead to heart failure.</p>

                     <p>This syndrome is a group of disorders of your body's metabolism, including increased waist size, high triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol), high blood pressure and high insulin levels.
                     These conditions make you more likely to develop diabetes, heart disease and stroke.</p>
